v2.0:

  * Added support for configuring host side of bonded network interfaces.
    The switch side still needs to be configured by hand, but at least
    the udb database entries can be entered by udb.

v2.1:

  * Fixed the most basic operations of udb to wok on Debian Jessie -
    mostly removing instances of deprecated behavior
