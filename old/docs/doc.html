    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h2>User's Guide</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    Explain about nids, ids.  The difference between network records
    and equpiment records.  An equipment record is the record of a
    physical thing -- something that can be kicked.  A network record
    can be associated with an equipment record, but it doesn't might
    not be.  In the former case, a simple user workstation probably
    has one equipment record and one network record.  A server with
    multiple network cards will have one equipment record, but
    multiple network records.  A dynamically assigned DHCP address has
    no equipment associated with it, but will have a network record.
    <p>
      To work with network records, <tt>cdb</tt> is used.  To work
      with equipment records, use <tt>edb</tt>.  You can think of
      <tt>cdb</tt> as being the new, improved cdb, and <tt>edb</tt> as
      being the new, (improved?) <tt>index</tt>.

    <h3>cdb</h3>
    <tt>cdb</tt> is used to manipulate network records.  There are
    serveral command you can give to cdb:
    <kbd><blockquote>
      cdb &lt;command&gt; [argument...]
      <ul>
	<li>profile
	<li>insert
	<li>delete
	<li>modify
	<li>query
      </ul>
    </blockquote></kbd>
    <h4>cdb profile</h4>
    <h4>cdb insert</h4>
    <h4>cdb delete</h4>
    NOTE: Unlike the old version of cdb, this version will confirm
    that you want to delete the record.
    <h4>cdb modify</h4>
    <h4>cdb query</h4>

    <h3>edb</h3>
    <h4>Location Ids</h4>
    Every peice of equipment has to be <em>somewhere</em>.  The
    location is tracked by the <tt>lid</tt>, the location idetifier.
    The <tt>lid</tt> for rooms in the CIT are simply the room number,
    and machines at a user's home will just be their username.  To get
    a list of available lids, you can enter a '?' at the prompt in
    edb.
    <p>
    If you don't know where an item is located, you can use the lid
    'unknown'.  However this is not recommended, as it will cause
    inventory problems. 

    <h4>edb profile</h4>
    <tt>profile</tt> displays the record for a single item.  It
    requires a single argument that can be an id, a hostname, or a
    search that returns a single item.  It simple prints the
    informatino about a peice of equipment.

    Example:
    <blockquote><pre>
	% edb profile 738
	id = 738
	hostnames = mandolin
	descr = Maxbuilt
	lid = 523
	serial number = 
	inventory number = CS-722
	type = Research
	comment = index host: mandolin
	po number = 952415
	po date = 5/1/2002
	po price = 
	po comment = 
	install date = 
	install comment = 
	users = Stan Zdonik
	cpu = 1.5GHz
	disk = 40GB
	memory = 500MB
	graphics = GF3
	conf_comment = 
    </pre></blockquote>
    The same record could be retrieved using the hostname:
    <blockquote><pre>% edb profile mandolin</pre></blockquote>
    or via a search: <blockquote><pre>edb profile inv=CS-722</pre></blockquote>
    For more information about searches, see edb query.

    <h4>edb insert</h4>
    <tt>insert</tt> creates a new equipment record.  <tt>insert</tt>
    accepts no argument, and will prompt you to fill in the data for
    an equipment record.  Note that the description field is required
    to be none empty.

    <h4>edb delete</h4>
    <tt>delete</tt> removes all traces of an equpiment record from the
    database.  It it final, and unrecoverable.  All the information
    in the record is lost after the deletion.  Use <tt>surplus</tt> to
    mark an item as surplused but continue to track it.
    <p>
      <tt>delete</tt> requires a single argument which can be an id, a
      hostname or a search that returns a single item.  You will be
      shown the profile information, and then asked to confirm the
      deletion.
    <p>
      You may receive the message "Orphaning network record
      &lt;hostname/nid&gt;" when you delete a record.  This message
      indicates that there are still network records still associated
      with the item you're deleting.  Since it's highly unlikely that
      an item that doesn't exist is still going to be on the network,
      this message is a strong indication that you shouldn't be
      deleteing the record.

    <h4>edb modify</h4>
    <tt>modify</tt> allows you to modify an existing record.  It takes
    a single argument, which can be a hostname, an id, or a search
    string that returns a single record.

    <h4>edb query</h4>
    <h4>edb surplus</h4>
    <tt>suplus</tt> is used to surplus an item.  It requires a single
    argument that can be an id, a hostname, or a search that returns a
    single item.  You will be shown the profile information on the
    item and asked if you wish to proceed.  If you do proceed, you
    will be prompted for some additional information regarding the
    surplusing.  (Note: if you later <tt>unsurplus</tt> this item,
    the information in these additional fields will be lost).

    <h4>edb unsurplus</h4>
    <tt>unsurplus</tt> is used to fix an accidently suplused item.  It
    takes a single argument, the equipment id of the item to be
    unsurplused.  You should note that the surplus information
    (surplus date, price, comment, buyer), if any, will be lost.

    <h3>pgaccess</h3>

    <h3>cdb_make</h3>

    <h3>SQL</h3>
    Hopefully, almost all of the day-to-day use of the database can be
    done with cdb/edb/pgaccess.  However, if the need arises, it's
    possible to directly access the database using pgsl, like this:
    <blockquote>
    <kbd>psql -h db.cs.brown.edu udb</kbd>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Transactions</h4>
    Whenever you use psql to change the database, it's a good
    idea to do it within a "transaction".  To start a transaction,
    execute:
    <blockquote>
      <kbd>begin;</kbd>
    </blockquote>
    at the psql prompt.  Now make whatever changes you need to, and
    <em>verify</em> that you've changed what you think you have.  If
    you're happy with the results, make your changes permanent by
    running:
    <blockquote>
      <kbd>commit;</kbd>
    </blockquote>
    at the psql prompt.  If you goofed, and the changes you made had
    unintened consiquences, you can cancel the transaction like this:
    <blockquote>
      <kbd>rollback;</kbd>
    </blockquote>
    If you are working within a transaction, be sure to
    <kbd>commit</kbd> before you exit psql, or you changes will be lost

    <h2>Developer's Guide</h2>

    <h3>CVS Repository</h3>
    All of the scripts and other files associated with "udb" are in a
    CVS repository.  The CVSROOT is /tstaff/projects/.CVS, so to
    checkout a copy of the latest stuff, run:
    <kbd><blockquote>
      cvs -d /tstaff/projects/.CVS co udb
    </blockquote></kbd>
    The <tt>README</tt> file that gets checked out should explain the
    directory hierarchy.

    <h3>The Database</h3>
    <h4>The Schema</h4>
    <img src="schema.gif">
    <h4>Buiding the Database</h4>

    <h3>cdb/edb</h3>

    <h3>cdb_make</h3>
    I tried to get to clever in my class inheritance, and created a
    mess.  It works, but it takes forever to find where to make
    changes.  This should really be fixed.

    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
    A major drawback to using a real data base is that in order to
    build the network files (i.e., run cdb_make), the systems must be
    up and running.  For example, since cdb_make depends on DNS
    function properly, if the DNS files get corrupt, they can't be
    rebuilt using cdb_make, as cdb_make needs to use DNS.  To get
    around this problem, it might be wise to keep copies of the
    network files in the build directory.

    <h3>Why Python?</h3>
    Okay, I know you're thinking to yourself, "Why the hell didn't he
    just user Perl?", so this is my answer.
    <p>
      I started off using Perl.  However, as the program grew, I tried
      to get more "object orienty", and that lead to an "impedance
      mismatch" with the database (I didn't make up that term.  It's
      apparently a well known problem, which I stumbled across as I
      re-invented the wheel).  I searched high and low for a Perl
      module that would automate the datbase to object mapping, and
      came up empty
    <p>
      However, in my searches I ran across "PyDO", which was exactly
      what I was looking for, but for the wrong language.  Not just
      the wrong language, but that screwed up one where whitespace
      matters.
    <p>
      After several false starts writing my own, I finally decided to
      try python and PyDO.  Once I got used to Python, I
      <em>loved</em> it, and PyDO did the job very nicely.

    <h4>Perl versus Python</h4>
    Don't worry -- I haven't completely gone off the Python deep end.
    I still use Perl.  In fact, the scripts that build the inital udb
    database are written in Perl.  For a task that requires lot's of
    slinging of strings and regular expressions, Perl is definately
    the right tool for the job.  On the other hand, Python's object
    oriented syntax is nicer, and for a program with anything but the
    most simple data structures, I'll use Python.

    <h2>To Do</h2>
    <h3>Features to Add</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Documentation
      <li>More testing of cdb_make

    </ul>
    <h3>Bugs to Fix</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>id</tt> is too general.  It should be called

	user.
      <li>Refactor <tt>cdb_make</tt>
    </ul>
