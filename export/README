This directory contains the helper scripts used by udb to export data from
the database and update the actual services or configuration files.  As udb 
will be calling these scripts, they need to have a common api.

Command Line Options

All scripts should require a single command line option be presented.  This
option can be either "update" or "export".  The update command line option
will cause the script to update any changed records, if possible.  The export
command line option, will cause the script to do a complete reload of all data
it is responsible for.

Return Codes

All scripts should return a code of "0" for successful completion.  A negative
return code is a fatal error, a positive return code is a warning error.
