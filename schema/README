Background

We set out to design a flexible database schema that would replace our 
current perl hash used to store host configurations.  This project grew 
to include 

Types of Machines

The schema should be loosely enough defined to support future types of 
machines.  It was desinged when we had the following types of systems:

- departemntal workstations:  These are the most common type of machine 
  we deploy.  It is the standard for every CS desktop and will be running
  either linux or windows.  Every machine of this type gets a consistent
  dhcp address, i.e. it is a "static" dhcp address, a corresponding DNS
  entry, mx entry

- internal servers

Types of Network Objects


Schema File Generation

The database schema is graphically designed using dia, which is used by the 
program tedia2sql to autogenerate an sql input file for postgres.  Once
the dia file is created, you can run the following to generate the sql.  
See http://tedia2sql.tigris.org for more information on how to use dia 
so that it is compatible with tedia2sql. 

./tedia2sql -t postgres -d -i schema.dia -o schema.sql
